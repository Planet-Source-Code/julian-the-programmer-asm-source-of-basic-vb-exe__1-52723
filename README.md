## Asm source of basic vb exe


</div>

### Description

As*embly source, all files are included also a short description of the as*embly language so you can understand the code yourself. You don't have to be an expert as*embly programmer to understand it, because it is fairly easy, and it also shows why VB has slow string manipulation, and other things. Well I will leave it to you to find these reasons.
